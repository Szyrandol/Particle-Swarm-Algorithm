n - number of particles in a swarm
t - number of time iterations 
c1, c2, c3 - weights responsible for changing the velocity of a particle in regards to its own velocity, its own best position and position of the best one in the swarm
at the bottom theres an animation of sorts showing how do the particles move through time
